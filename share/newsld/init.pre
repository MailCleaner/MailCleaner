# This is the right place to customize your installation of SpamAssassin.
#
# See 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf' for details of what can be
# tweaked.
#
# This file contains plugin activation commands for plugins included
# in SpamAssassin 3.0.x releases.  It will not be installed if you
# already have a file in place called "init.pre".
#
# There are now multiple files read to enable plugins in the 
# /etc/mail/spamassassin directory; previously only one, "init.pre" was 
# read.  Now both "init.pre", "v310.pre", and any other files ending in
# ".pre" will be read.  As future releases are made, new plugins will be
# added to new files, named according to the release they're added in.

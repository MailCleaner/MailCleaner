";


### Verified
$help['DOMAINDELIVERY'] =
    "<h1>Delivery settings</h1>
These settings define how messages will be handled once they have been
processed by MailCleaner.<br/><br/>
<h2>Destination server:</h2>
This is the server to which messages for this domain will be forwarded once
they have been processed.<br/> Generally, this is either the final mail server
for the domain or another gateway. <br/><br/> You can enter a (fully qualified)
hostname or an IP address.<br/> For multiple destination servers (when load
balancing), you can separate the different hosts with \":\". (i.e.,
host1.domain.com:host2.domain.com).
<h2>Use MX record:</h2>
If enabled, MailCleaner will use the DNS MX records for routing messages to the
destination mail server rather than using the \"Destination server\" setting.
<br/>
<b>Warning:</b> This option should <b>only</b> be used if e-mail addresses are
rewritten during delivery, or if your MailCleaner server uses a local,
nonpublic DNS server that has been customized for this purpose.
<h2>Action on spam:</h2>
This will define how to handle messages that are detected as spam.<br/>
This setting can be overridden by user preferences.
<ul>
<li><b>tag:</b> spam will be delivered to the destination mail server, but will
include a tag in the subject. This may be useful if you wish to create an
incoming rule on your final mail server to drop these messages into a specific
folder.<br/><br/>
<li><b>quarantine:</b> spam will not be delivered to the destination mail
server, but will be stored in the MailCleaner quarantine. Users may view the
content of the quarantine in real time using the web interface, or through the
periodic e-mail summaries.
<br/>This is the most common setting.<br/><br/>
<li><b>drop:</b> spam will not be delivered to the destination mail server and
will be dropped. There is no means of retrieving these messages, and no log
will be generated. Used in rare circumstances.
</ul>
<h2>Enable SMTP callout:</h2>
In principle, MailCleaner has no means of knowing which e-mail addresses are
configured on your destination mail server. Therefore, by default, it accepts
all messages destined for the configured domains, regardless of the name part
of the address. This leads to a great deal of unnecessary load on the
MailCleaner server, since it must process messages for nonexistent recipients
only to have these messages rejected afterward by the destination mail server.<p>
If you enable the SMTP callout option, MailCleaner will first check the validity of the
recipient address by doing an SMTP callout to your destination mail server.<br/> This
may considerably reduce the load on your system if you are prone to dictionary
spam attacks.<br/> The downside to using this option is a slight increase in
network traffic between MailCleaner and your destination mail server(s) due to
callout requests. But MailCleaner keeps the results of such requests in cache,
thereby minimizing such traffic as much as possible.<br/> This option is not
recommended if your destination mail server acts as a gateway and does not
refuse nonexistent addresses during the SMTP dialog (i.e.  MS Exchange Server <=
5.5)

<h2>Enable LDAP/AD callout:</h2>
This option is similar to SMTP callout, except that it uses LDAP/Active
Directory to validate addresses. <br/>To use this option, you must configure
\"LDAP/AD callout configuration\" on the SMTP Configuration page.
<p><b>Do not enable both SMTP callout AND LDAP/AD callout.</b>

This is the tag that will prefix the subject of the message if a virus has been
detected and removed from the message. You may set this as a blank string to
avoid appending tags altogether. (In this case, you would still be able to
filter against the X-MailCleaner headers in the final mail server or mail
client if need be.)

<h2>Antispam:</h2>
Enable or disable the spam detection engine of MailCleaner.
<h2>Tag:</h2>
This is the tag that will prefix the subject if the message has been detected

summaries and virus/dangerous content warnings. This is also the address which
will be alerted if a user requests that a message held in quarantine be
analyzed.
";


### Verified
$help['USERAUTHENTICATION'] =
    "<h1>User authentication</h1>
MailCleaner can authenticate users in a variety of ways.<br/><br/>
Instead of storing user credentials locally on MailCleaner, you can use the different mechanisms (connectors) in order to authenticate against your existing credential database.  <br/>
This allows your users to access the user interface to consult their quarantine
and set their preferences without the superfluous overhead of yet another
password database.
<h2>Connector: </h2>
This is the mechanism used for authentication.
<ul>
<li><b>local</b>: authenticate against users local to the machine.
<li><b>mysql</b>: authenticate against a mysql database.
<li><b>imap</b>: authenticate against an imap server.
<li><b>pop3</b>: authenticate against a pop3 server.
<li><b>ldap</b>: authenticate against a ldap or active directory server.
<li><b>radius</b>: authenticate against a radius server.
</ul>
<h2>Server and Port: </h2>
This is the name or IP address of the server against which you want MailCleaner
to do the authentication. The field after the \":\" is the port used for the
authentication. (The standard IANA-assigned ports are 3306 for mysql, 143 for
imap, 110 for pop3, 389 for ldap, and 1812 for radius.)
<h2>Use SSL:</h2>
If enabled, the sessions established for user authentication will be encrypted.
<h2>Username format: </h2>
This is the username format that your authentication server requires. Often,
multi-domain mail servers expect the domain to be appended to the username in
order to differentiate accounts of different domains.
<ul>
<li><b>username@domain: </b> MailCleaner will append an \"@\" and the domain to
the username (if not already present in the username) before authentication.
<li><b>username%domain: </b> MailCleaner will append a \"%\" and the domain to
the username (if not already present in the username) before authentication.
<li><b>username: </b> no change is made to the username.
</ul>
<h2>Address format: </h2>
MailCleaner organizes its quarantine by e-mail address, not by username.
Therefore, when a user logs on to MailCleaner for the first time, if the
username isn't the same as the e-mail address, a mechanism is necessary to
allow MailCleaner to correspond the quarantine (e-mail address) to the
username.  <br/>
The Address format is the means by which MailCleaner will bind the correct
e-mail address(es) to the authenticated user. Using this format template,
MailCleaner can deduce the e-mail address based on the username.
<ul>
<li><b>local lookup: </b>This option can be used if the Connector is <b>local</b> or if no others apply. In the latter case, you will need to manually create users and their addresses via the \"<b>Manage by users</b>\" interface.
<li><b>username@domain: </b>the address will be constructed with the username and the domain name.
<li><b>ldap lookup: </b>the address(es) will be fetched from the ldap/active directory.
<li><b>text file lookup: </b>the address(es) will be fetched from a local file.
<li><b>mysql lookup: </b>the address(es) will be fetched from a mysql server.
</ul>

<h2><b>LDAP SUPPLEMENTARY FIELDS</b></h2>
The following fields are available if you have chosen ldap as your connector.
<h2>Use SSL (ldaps): </h2>Enable this if your LDAP uses SSL (LDAPS).
<h2>Protocol version: </h2>Version of the LDAP server protocol. For example, Windows Server 2003 uses version 3.
<h2>Base DN:</h2>The basic DN of the LDAP server.
<h2>User attribute:</h2>The LDAP attribute that contains the user name.
<h2>Bind user (optional):</h2>
If the LDAP server does not allow anonymous access (e.g., AD 2003), this is the
username to connect the LDAP directory.
<h2>Bind password (optional):</h2>The password for the Bind User.
";


$help['WHITEWARNLIST'] =
    "<h1>Whitelists and warnlists</h1>
<b>Whitelists</b> let users set up a list of sender that will never be flagged as spam or put in quarantine.
Although this option may be convenient, it is also very dangerous as spammers tend to forge the sender address to fake someone you know.
<br>With many entries in whitelists, your filter may become less efficient and being open to smart spam campains.
<br><br>
<b>Warnlists</b> are a less dangerous method because it forces the user to be more attentive to the list he sets.<br> Instead of simply let the message go through when the sender is listed,
 the system will send a warning message to the final recipient noticing that is has been put in quarantine. This way, the user is aware that something went wrong with the filter
 and can eventually forward the problem to the administrator.<br>Moreover, the user who receives a warning for a real spam will know where the error lies, and not simply believe that the filter has let it go through.
<br><br>
Althoug it is always better to avoid any kind of list, it is advised for the administrator who really needs it, to only enable warnlists first.
<br>Enabling both is possible, but may not be very usefull.
<br>Now if you really want to enable whitelists for the whole domain, you have been warned !

<h1>Settings for an email address</h1>
The user can define how to handle spam for each individual address under his
account. Using this interface, you can modify settings on behalf of the
user.<br/><br/>
<h2>Action on spam: </h2>
There are three different ways that MailCleaner can handle messages determined to be spam:
    <ul>
        <li><b>tag: </b>Route the message as usual, but insert a tag at
        the beginning of the subject line to make the message readily
        identifiable as spam
        <li><b>quarantine: </b>Put the spam in quarantine, where the
        user can force its release at a later time if desired
        <li><b>drop: </b>Delete the message altogether
    </ul>
<h2>Tag: </h2>
This is the tag that would be inserted in the subject line if \"tag\" is selected as the Action to take, above.
<h2>Quarantine postmaster errors: </h2>
If enabled, all non-delivery reports (NDRs) sent to this address are tagged or
quarantined, depending on the \"Action on spam\" setting.  This is useful when
a user's address has been used as the sender's address in a spam or virus
campaign; in this case, the user could receive hundreds of NDRs in the period
of a few days.<br/>
While this function is useful on a short-term basis, we advise you to disable
it a few weeks after enabling it, as it also quarantines legitimate NDRs (which
would be sent, for example, if the user misspells an e-mail address).
<h2>Summary frequency: </h2>
The frequency at which the user of this address automatically receives a Spam Summary Report for this address.
<h2>Language: </h2>
The language of Spam summary reports and any other automated messages sent by MailCleaner.

In MailCleaner, messages pass through three general stages:

<li> The messages are filtered for viruses and spam.
<li> Clean messages are passed to an outgoing queue, which are then delivered by a <i>post-filtering</i> MTA process.
</nl>
You can choose to view/alter the settings below for the pre-filtering (incoming) or post-filtering (outgoing) stage.<br/>

<h2>Connection timeout: </h2>This sets a timeout value for SMTP reception. If a line of input (either an SMTP command or a data line) is not received within this time, the SMTP connection is dropped and the message is abandoned.

<h2>Maximum simultaneous connections: </h2>
This option specifies the maximum number of simultaneous incoming SMTP calls that the MTA process will accept. If the value is set to zero, no limit is applied.

<h2>Maximum connections per host: </h2>
This option restricts the number of simultaneous IP connections from a single host (strictly, from a single IP address) to the MTA process. Once the limit is reached, additional connection attempts from the same host are rejected with error code 421. The default value of zero imposes no limit.

<h2>Ignore bounces after: </h2> [2d]
This option affects the processing of bounce messages that cannot be delivered, that is, those that suffer a permanent delivery failure. (Bounce messages that suffer temporary delivery failures are of course retried in the usual way.)

<h2>Timeout frozen after: </h2> [7d]
If this value is set to a time greater than zero, a frozen message of any kind that has been on the queue for longer than the given time is automatically cancelled at the next queue run. If it is a bounce message, it is just discarded; otherwise, a bounce is sent to the sender.

$help['ANTIVIRUSSETTINGS'] =
    "<h1>Antivirus: Settings</h1>
MailCleaner uses antivirus software to verify that attachments
do not contain known viruses. All the same, even if an
attached file is not found to contain a known virus, it will
be withheld if the contents or filename are deemed
suspicious.<br/>
The settings found here affect how MailCleaner interacts with
the chosen antivirus software (ClamAV by default), as well as
attachment processing in general.<br/><br/>
<h2>Don't warn on known viruses: </h2>If this feature is enabled, MailCleaner
will not issue a virus warning if the attachment in question contains a virus
confirmed by the antivirus module. It will not deliver the infected message to
the recipient. Because most modern viruses forge the sender's address to cover
their tracks, it is generally pointless to issue a virus alert. Users will
still be warned if messages with otherwise potentially dangerous content are
quarantined.
<h2>Maximum message size: </h2>If this value is set, MailCleaner will
quarantine all messages larger than the given size. In this case, a warning
will be sent to the user (unless the user has disabled warning reception); this
warning is much like a <i><a href=\"help.php?s=CONTENTFILTERTITLE\">virus or
dangerous content warning</a></i>, including an identification string in the
same format.<br/> Such withheld messages can be released by the administrator
via the <b>content quarantine</b> page in the admin interface.<br/> A value of 0
(the default value) means that there is no size limit to messages. However, any
size limits imposed by the destination mail server will still apply.
<h2>Maximum attachment size: </h2>If this value is set,
MailCleaner will quarantine all attachments larger than the given size. In this
case, a warning will be sent to the user (unless the user has disabled warning
reception); this warning is much like a <i><a
href=\"help.php?s=CONTENTFILTERTITLE\">virus or dangerous content
warning</a></i>, including an identification string in the same format.<br/>
Such withheld attachments can be released by the administrator via the
<b>content quarantine</b> page in the admin interface.<br/> A value of -1 (the
default value) means that there is no size limit to messages.<br/> A value of 0
means that no attachments are permitted.<br/>
<h2>Maximum archive depth: </h2>Sometimes, archive files
(.zip, .tar.gz, etc.) are re-archived, i.e., a .zip within a
.zip. Generally, this is done by mistake or for dubious
reasons. If desired, a maximum depth of archives within
archives can be defined here.<br/>
A value of 0 (the default value) means that there is no limit
to the depth of archives.
<h2>Expand TNEF: </h2>Microsoft Exchange and Outlook e-mail clients use a
proprietary format called TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format) when
sending messages formatted in Rich Text Format (RTF). When Microsoft Exchange
believes that the recipient uses a Microsoft mail client, it extract all
formatting information and encodes it in a special TNEF block. The resulting
message is in two parts: the text message with all formatting removed, and the
TNEF block (which includes the formatting instructions). Unfortunately, if the
recipient does not use a Microsoft mail client, the mail client can do nothing
with the TNEF block. It generally appears as an attachment called
winmail.dat.<br/> MailCleaner is capable of expanding TNEF blocks in order to
analyze formatting data therein. It is preferable to leave this option active.
<h2>Deliver bad TNEF: </h2>In general, it is a bad idea to deliver messages
with improperly formatted TNEF blocks, as it can cause a variety of errors with
Microsoft Exchange Server as well as a number of mail clients. Therefore, it is
best to leave this option unchecked. However, if you regularly receive e-mails
from an organization with improperly formatted messages that are quarantined,
you may wish to experiment with this option.
<h2>Send notices (notices to): </h2>This option allows the administrator to
send a copy of <b>all</b> e-mail notices generated by MailCleaner to a central
administrative address.  Any e-mail notice that would be generated to alert a
user of a spam or virus would also be sent to this address, regardless of
whether or not the user has enabled notice reception in their personal
preferences.
<h2>Virus scanner timeout: </h2>If the antivirus module takes too long to
process a message, it will time out and pass the message on to the next module.
(In this case, the message will not be safely filtered for viruses.) The
timeout period is defined here, in seconds.
<h2>File type control timeout: </h2>Certain files are withheld purely on the
basis of their file type. If this analysis
takes an unusually long time for any reason, the analysis will time out and
pass the message to the next module. The timeout duration can be modified here.
<h2>TNEF expander timeout: </h2>If TNEF expansion takes an unusually long time
for any reason, the expansion will time out and pass the message to the next
module. The timeout duration can be modified here.

These settings cover often-used html code that can be used maliciously. Most of these technologies are used regularly on Internet web sites for legitimate reasons.

For these options, check the \"Set as Silent\" box to prevent the user from receiving a warning when messages are blocked by each of these criteria.<br/>
<h2>IFrame tags: </h2>This could allow a maliciously written e-mail to download and execute code from an outside source.
<h2>Form tags: </h2>E-mail messages rarely contain forms for legitimate reasons. For example, forms are often used by phishers. (<i>Phishing</i> is the act of trying to dupe users into divulging information regarding their personal bank accounts, credit cards, or passwords.) All the same, forms are occasionally used in legitimate general distributions such as newsletters.
<h2>Script tags: </h2>HTML can contain scripts, for example, Javascript or VBScript. Generally, scripts in e-mail messages should be avoided. All the same, forms are occasionally used in legitimate general distributions such as newsletters.
<h2>CodeBase tags: </h2>The codebase attribute of the &lt;object&gt; tag can be used to insert the URL of a remotely located object (ActiveX component, applet, image map, plug-in, media player, etc.) in a message. This can leave the user unprotected against various Microsoft-specific security vulnerabilities. It is best to leave this option blocked unless your users demand its activation.
<h2>Web Bugs: </h2>Spammers sometimes include images in their messages that are downloaded from a remote server upon opening the message. Often, the URLs for these images are unique to each message; this allows the spammers to know that a particular address is valid, because the image URL will contain enough information for the server delivering the image to identify the recipient's e-mail address.<br/>These uniquely formed URLs--used to validate recipients' e-mail addresses--are called Web Bugs.
MailCleaner can disarm Web Bugs so that the message can be safely opened without sending any compromising information to outside servers.

<h2>Partial messages: </h2>A Message that is sent as fragments over many messages. The user's mail client could re-assemble the message, including a malicious attachment.

Today, viruses and worms are the most prevalent form of dangerous file attachment. But antivirus software alone is not enough to deal with dangerous attachments. Antivirus software is ineffective in two areas: in the brief period when a new virus, or a new variant of a known virus, is first released in the wild; and when dealing with malicious code (scripts or embedded Visual Basic code, for example) that specifically targets a user or group of users.<br/> <br/>
In order to complement antivirus software when protecting users from malicious attachments, MailCleaner quarantines attachments that are suspiciously named or of a particularly vulnerable file type (for example, self-executing files). In this case, the administrator must release the file in question. The administrator can customize MailCleaner to be more or less restrictive as need be.<br/><br/>
<h2>Filename control: </h2>This list shows all file types that MailCleaner is configured to handle, as well as the action to take for each file type (allow or deny).
<h3>Action: </h3>If \"deny\", this file type is automatically quarantined.
<h3>Rule: </h3>The definition that the file name must satisfy in order to fall into this rule. These rules follow <a href=\"http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlre.html\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Perl Regular Expression</i></a> syntax.
<h3>Name: </h3>A short name for the file extension. This will be used in the log files.

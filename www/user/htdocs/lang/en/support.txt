               <ul>
                 <li> <h2>What does Mailcleaner do?</h2>
                      Mailcleaner is an e-mail filter that check your incoming messages against known spam, viruses and other dangerous content, avoiding it from even reaching your desktop. It is a server side solution, which means you don't have any software installed on your system to get your e-mails filtered. This is actually done by your e-mail account provider. With web based interface, you are directly connected to the Mailcleaner filter, from which you can tune some settings of the filter, and see all blocked spam.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>What is a spam?</h2>
                      Spam is unsolicited or undesired e-mail messages. Generally used for advertisements, these messages can quickly fill up your inbox. These message are generally not dangerous, but nontheless really annoying.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>What are viruses and dangerous content?</h2>
                      Viruses are small softwares able to exploit and let malicious people take control of your computer. These can be sent to you in e-mail as attachments, and infect your system once opened (some can even be enabled without being opened). Dangerous content are the same, except that it can be enabled by more intelligent means, hidding directly in the content of the message, or even being targeted from the outside by a bounce link into the e-mail. These are very difficult to detect by the use of standard e-mail filters, because the real virus is not really included within the message. Mailcleaner carries out more checks than that to prevent potentially risky e-mail from reaching your inbox.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>Mailcleaner antispam criteria</h2>
                      Mailcleaner uses a number of tests in order to detect spam with the best possible accuracy. It uses amongst others, simple keyword or keyphrase matching, worldwide spam databases and statistical token computing. The aggregation of all these criterias will give an overall score for each message, upon wich Mailcleaner will take the final decision: Spam or ham. As spam is a really fast moving target, these rules are also adapted as fast as possible. This is the job of Mailcleaner to keep these settings as good as possible.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>Errors</h2>
                      Since Mailcleaner is an automated filtering system, it is also prone to mistakes. There are basically two kinds of errors that can be generated by Mailcleaner:
                      <ul>
                       <li> <h3>False negatives</h3> False negatives are spam messages that managed to slip through the Mailcleaner filter and reach your inbox without being detected. These are annoying, but as long as the occurance is relatively rare, no significant loss will be endured for your productivity at work. Remember when you got only a couple of spam messages each week? Mailcleaner can get you back to at least this point.
                       </li>
                       <li> <h3>False positives</h3> These are more annoying errors, as they are the result of valid e-mails being blocked by the system. If you are not vigilant enough and do not check either your quarantine or reports carefully, this can lead to the loss of important messages. Mailcleaner is optimised to reduce these mistakes as much as possible. However, altough it is very very rare, this can happen. This is why Mailcleaner includes real-time quarantine access and periodic reports to help you minimize the risk of message loss.
                       </li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li> <h2>What you can do to correct Mailcleaner</h2>
                      Upon Mailcleaner mistakes, the best thing to do is help correct the filter by sending feedback to your administrator. Do not think the best solution is to just white- or blacklist senders as this is just a fast but dirty way (check this for more information). Although it sometimes is the only possibility, it is always better to find out the real cause of the error, and correct it. This can only be done by technical people, so don't hesitate to send feedback following errors to your administrator.

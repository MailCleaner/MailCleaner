# @{etc_ro} contains a space-separated list of the system configuration directories.
# Traditionally this means /etc/, but when using a read-only / filesystem and/or
# with the goal of having only user-modified config files in /etc/, directories
# like /usr/etc/ get introduced for storing the default config.

# @{etc_ro} contains directories with configuration files, including read-only directories.
# Do not use @{etc_ro} in rules that allow write access.
@{etc_ro}=/etc/ /usr/etc/

# @{etc_rw} contains directories where writing to configuration files is allowed.
# @{etc_rw} should always be a subset of @{etc_ro}.
#
# Only use @{etc_rw} if the profile allows writing to a configuration file.
# For rules that only allows read access, use @{etc_ro}.
@{etc_rw}=/etc/

# Also, include files in tunables/etc.d/ for site-specific adjustments to
# @{etc_ro} and @{etc_rw}.
include if exists <tunables/etc.d>

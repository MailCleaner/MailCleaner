# This abstraction is designed to be used in a child profile to limit what
# confined application can invoke via gio helper.
#
# NOTE: most likely you want to use xdg-open abstraction instead for better
# portability across desktop environments, unless you are sure that confined
# application only uses /usr/bin/gio directly.
#
# Usage example:
#
# ```
# profile foo /usr/bin/foo {
# ...
# /usr/bin/gio rPx -> foo//gio-open,
# ...
# } # end of main profile
#
# # out-of-line child profile
# profile foo//gio-open {
#   include <abstractions/gio-open>
#
#   # needed for ubuntu-* abstractions

#   include <abstractions/ubuntu-browsers>
#   include <abstractions/ubuntu-email>

#   # < add additional allowed applications here >

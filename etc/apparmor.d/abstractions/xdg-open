# This abstraction is designed to be used in a child profile to limit what
# confined application can invoke via xdg-open helper. xdg-open abstraction
# will allow to use gio-open, kde-open5 and other helpers of the different
# desktop environments.
#
# Usage example:
#
# ```
# profile foo /usr/bin/foo {
# ...
# /usr/bin/xdg-open rPx -> foo//xdg-open,
# ...
# } # end of main profile
#
# # out-of-line child profile
# profile foo//xdg-open {
#   include <abstractions/xdg-open>
#
#   # Enable a11y support if considered required by
#   # profile author for (rare) error message boxes.
#   include <abstractions/dbus-accessibility>
#
#   # Enable gstreamer support if considered required by
#   # profile author for (rare) error message boxes.
#   include if exists <abstractions/gstreamer>
#
#   # needed for ubuntu-* abstractions
#   include <abstractions/ubuntu-helpers>
#
#   # Only allow to handle http[s]: and mailto: links
#   include <abstractions/ubuntu-browsers>
#   include <abstractions/ubuntu-email>
#
#   # < add additional allowed applications here >

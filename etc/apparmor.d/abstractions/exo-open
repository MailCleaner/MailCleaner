# This abstraction is designed to be used in a child profile to limit what
# confined application can invoke via exo-open helper.
#
# NOTE: most likely you want to use xdg-open abstraction instead for better
# portability across desktop environments, unless you are sure that confined
# application only uses /usr/bin/exo-open directly.
#
# Usage example:
#
# ```
# profile foo /usr/bin/foo {
# ...
# /usr/bin/exo-open rPx -> foo//exo-open,
# ...
# } # end of main profile
#
# # out-of-line child profile
# profile foo//exo-open {

#   include <abstractions/ubuntu-browsers>

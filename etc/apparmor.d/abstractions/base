  # Workaround https://launchpad.net/bugs/359338 until upstream handles stacked
  # filesystems generally. This does not appreciably decrease security with
  # Ubuntu profiles because the user is expected to have access to files owned
  # by him/her. Exceptions to this are explicit in the profiles. While this rule
  # grants access to those exceptions, the intended privacy is maintained due to
  # the encrypted contents of the files in this directory. Files in this
  # directory will also use filename encryption by default, so the files are
  # further protected. Also, with the use of 'owner', this rule properly
  # prevents access to the files from processes running under a different uid.

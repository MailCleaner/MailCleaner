# abstraction for allowing console email clients in Ubuntu. These will
# typically also need a terminal, so when using this abstraction, should also
# do something like:
#
# include <abstractions/ubuntu-gnome-terminal>
#
# Users of this abstraction need to include the ubuntu-helpers abstraction
# in the toplevel profile. Eg:
#   include <abstractions/ubuntu-helpers>

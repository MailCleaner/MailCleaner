# This abstraction is designed to be used in a child profile to limit what
# confined application can invoke via kde-open5 helper.
#
# NOTE: most likely you want to use xdg-open abstraction instead for better
# portability across desktop environments, unless you are sure that confined
# application only uses /usr/bin/kde-open5 directly.
#
# Usage example:
#
# ```
# profile foo /usr/bin/foo {
# ...
# /usr/bin/kde-open5 rPx -> foo//kde-open5,
# ...
# } # end of main profile
#
# # out-of-line child profile
# profile foo//kde-open5 {

# This directory is intended to contain profile additions and overrides for
# inclusion by distributed profiles to aid in packaging AppArmor for
# distributions.
#
# The shipped profiles in /etc/apparmor.d can still be modified by an
# administrator and people should modify the shipped profile when making
# large policy changes, rather than trying to make those adjustments here.
#
# For simple access additions or the occasional deny override, adjusting them
# here can prevent the package manager of the distribution from interfering
# with local modifications. As always, new policy should be reviewed to ensure
# it is appropriate for your site.
#
# For example, if the shipped /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.smbd profile has:
#   include <local/usr.sbin.smbd>
#
# then an administrator can adjust /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.smbd to
# contain any additional paths to be allowed, such as:
#
#   /var/exports/** lrwk,
#
# Keep in mind that 'deny' rules are evaluated after allow rules, so you won't
# be able to allow access to files that are explicitly denied by the shipped
# profile using this mechanism.

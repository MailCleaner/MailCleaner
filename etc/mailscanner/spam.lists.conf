# This file translates the names of the spam lists and spam domains lists
# into the real DNS domains to search.

# There is a far more comprehensive list of these at
# http://www.declude.com/JunkMail/Support/ip4r.htm
# and you can easily search them all at www.DNSstuff.com.

# If you want to search other DNSBL's you will need to define them here first,
# before referring to them by name in mailscanner.conf (or a rules file).

# These two lists are now dead and must not be used.

# MAPS now charge for their services, so you'll have to buy a contract before
# attempting to use the next 3 lines.

MAPS-RBL			blackholes.mail-abuse.org.

MAPS-RSS			relays.mail-abuse.org.

# This next line works for JANET UK Academic sites only

MAPS-RBL+			rbl-plus.mail-abuse.ja.net.

# And build a similar list for the RBL domains that work on the name
# of the domain rather than the IP address of the exact machine that
# is listed. This way the RBL controllers can blacklist entire
# domains very quickly and easily.
# These aren't used by default, as they slow down MailScanner quite a bit.
